GLULOOP is an open research platform for the simulation and validation of 
glucose control strategies using a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) approach.

The platform integrates clinically validated physiological models 
(UVA/Padova T1DM) with advanced control algorithms such as ADRC, 
providing a safe and reproducible environment for control research 
in artificial pancreas systems.
